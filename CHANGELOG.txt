1.2.0
  - Blur radius for predither is now user-definable
    Default radius is 2 (pixels). Bigger radius blurs the input image more, which yields less
    detailed and therefore less painful to draw predither images.

  - Slight performance improvement when downscaling the input image is not wanted

  - Minor code improvements

1.1.0
  - Drastically improved the predither algorithm.
    It now uses a slight box blur before converting the colors, giving a less complex result.

  - CLI now shows program version

  - CLI now shows the time it took to convert images

  - CLI now shows the final resolution and total pixel count of the generated image(s)

1.0.0
  - First usable version!

  - Floyd-Steinberg dithering algorithm

  - Splitting images by colors

  - Scaling down images

  - Very basic predithering

  - Basic interactive commandline interface
