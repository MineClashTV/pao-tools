# pao-tools
A few simple tools for getting statistics about your projects and image splitting functionality.

## Usage
There is no interface yet - get the source, change the stuff, and pray for it to work.

## Development
This is still under heavy development and things will get better eventually.
Contributions welcome!

TODOs:
  - Higher efficiency; less iterations over image. As of right now, running this program on a 34 color image needs 104 iterations.
  - Make it usable for the average player; web interface or GUI.
  - More splitting algorithms; currently only splits colors as they are with transparent BGs. Works for me, but I know some people prefer to work differently.
